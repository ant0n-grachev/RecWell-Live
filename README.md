# RecWell Live

A lightweight Progressive Web App that surfaces real-time occupancy for the University of Wisconsin-Madison RecWell facilities (Nick and Bakke). The UI focuses on at-a-glance capacity signals, mobile-first ergonomics, and installability so you can pin the dashboard to your phone like a native app.

## Key features

- **Live occupancy feed**: Fetches the public RecWell endpoint on demand with abort-safe requests so stale data never flashes.
- **Category breakdowns**: Fitness floors, courts, pools, track, ice, and "Other" sections automatically group and display their individual load plus overall totals.
- **Status cues**: Color-coded percentages and explicit CLOSED badges make capacity issues obvious.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19 + TypeScript** for the component architecture
- **Vite** tooling for fast dev/build cycles
- **Material UI 7** for layout primitives and theming
- **Axios** for API access
- **Service Worker + Web Manifest** for PWA install support
